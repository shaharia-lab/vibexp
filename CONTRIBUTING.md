## 📋 Issue Reporting Guidelines

To help us process your contribution quickly:

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search first** - Your issue might already be reported or answered
2. **Check documentation** - Make sure it's not covered in our [docs](https://vibexp.io/docs)
3. **One issue per report** - Don't combine multiple bugs or features

### When Creating an Issue

1. **Use appropriate templates** - They guide you through providing necessary information
2. **Be specific and detailed** - Vague descriptions slow down resolution
3. **Stay focused** - Keep discussions on-topic
4. **Be respectful** - Constructive feedback helps everyone

### After Creating an Issue

- **Respond to questions** - We may need clarification
- **Update if resolved** - Let us know if you find a workaround
- **Be patient** - We review all submissions but may need time to respond

After you submit an issue or feature request:

1. **VibeXP team reviews** - We read every submission within 1-3 business days

3. **Roadmap consideration** - Popular requests are prioritized for development
4. **Regular updates** - We'll keep you informed of progress and decisions
5. **Community feedback** - Others can vote and comment on your submission
