## About VibeXP

VibeXP is an AI-powered platform designed to transform your AI workflow from chaotic to organized. We help developers, content creators, and product designers build personal knowledge bases that integrate seamlessly with the tools they already love.

With VibeXP, you can:
- **Organize prompts** into reusable templates with dynamic variables
- **Store context** that your AI remembers across all conversations
- **Capture artifacts** automatically so valuable outputs never get lost
- **Integrate everywhere** through our MCP Server, REST API, and CLI tools

Stop rewriting prompts. Stop re-explaining context. Stop losing valuable AI-generated content in endless chat histories.
